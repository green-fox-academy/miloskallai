        you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times
        they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They
        called me Mr Glass. Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this
        shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case,
        it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over
        to your dumb ass.</div>
